    title: 'Hydration is Key: Stay Consistently Hydrated',

    desc: '''
    Why it’s important:
    Hydration is crucial for swimmers due to the physical demands of their sport. Dehydration can impair performance, reduce endurance, and increase the risk of cramping. Since swimming is often done in water, it can be easy to forget to hydrate, but it’s still essential to replenish fluids during and after training.

    Tips:

    Pre-Training Hydration: Drink water or a sports drink at least 30 minutes before your swim session. Aim for 500-600 ml of fluids before exercise.
    During Training: Sip water every 15-20 minutes during intense training, especially if it lasts more than an hour.
    Post-Training Hydration: Replenish lost fluids after training with water, electrolyte beverages, or a recovery drink to restore hydration levels.
    Ideal Fluids: Water is the best option, but if you're swimming for extended periods or in hot conditions, drinks with electrolytes like sodium and potassium can help maintain fluid balance.

    title: 'Fuel Up with Carbohydrates: Energy for Endurance',
    imagePath: 'assets/images/content/nutrition/nutrition2.jpg',

    Why it’s important:
    Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for swimmers, especially for high-intensity efforts. They provide the energy needed for training, competition, and recovery. A well-balanced diet rich in carbs ensures swimmers maintain stamina and can perform at their best during long sessions.

    Tips:

    Pre-Swim Meal: Consume a meal rich in carbs about 2-3 hours before swimming. Good options include pasta, rice, oats, or whole-grain bread with some protein.
    Snack Before Training: If you're short on time, a smaller carb-based snack like a banana, granola bar, or toast with jam 30-60 minutes before swimming can help fuel your workout.
    Carb-Rich Post-Swim Meal: After swimming, replenish glycogen stores with carb-rich foods like quinoa, sweet potatoes, fruits, and whole grains.
    Ideal Carbs: Focus on whole, complex carbs, like brown rice, whole wheat bread, and vegetables, but also include simple carbs like fruits (e.g., bananas, apples) for quick energy.

    title: 'Protein for Recovery and Muscle Repair',
    imagePath: 'assets/images/content/nutrition/nutrition3.jpg',
    desc: '''Why it’s important:
    Protein is essential for muscle repair and recovery after intense swim sessions. Consuming enough protein after training helps rebuild muscle tissue that may have been broken down during exertion. This is particularly important for swimmers training multiple times a day.

    Tips:

    Post-Training Protein: Aim for 15-30 grams of protein within 30-60 minutes after swimming. Protein sources can include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, tofu, or protein shakes.
    Balanced Meals: Ensure your daily meals contain a source of protein, such as chicken, turkey, salmon, or plant-based options like lentils, beans, or tempeh.
    Ideal Protein Sources: Opt for high-quality proteins such as chicken, turkey, fish (especially salmon and tuna), Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, and plant-based options like quinoa or chickpeas.

    title: 'Healthy Fats for Sustained Energy',
    imagePath: 'assets/images/content/nutrition/nutrition4.jpg',
    desc: '''
    Why it’s important:
    Healthy fats provide long-lasting energy, which is vital for swimmers, especially during endurance events or longer training sessions. Fat also supports brain health and helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K.

    Tips:

    Incorporate Healthy Fats into Meals: Include healthy fats from sources like avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.
    Pre-Swim Meal: Include a small amount of fat in your pre-swim meal, such as a handful of almonds or a slice of avocado, to provide steady energy throughout your training session.
    Post-Swim Recovery: Healthy fats can also be added to post-workout meals, like mixing chia seeds or flaxseeds into your smoothie or salad.
    Ideal Fats: Focus on unsaturated fats such as those found in avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel.

    title: 'Vitamins and Minerals for Optimal Performance',
    imagePath: 'assets/images/content/nutrition/nutrition5.jpg',
    desc: '''
    Why it’s important:
    Swimmers need a wide range of vitamins and minerals to support energy production, immune function, and overall performance. Key nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, iron, and magnesium play essential roles in muscle function, oxygen transport, and bone health.

    Tips:

    Iron for Endurance: Ensure you get enough iron from sources like lean red meat, beans, spinach, or fortified cereals, as it helps with oxygen transport during intense exercise.
    Calcium and Vitamin D for Bone Health: Include dairy products, leafy greens, or fortified alternatives to support bone density, which is vital for swimmers to avoid injuries.
    Magnesium for Muscle Function: Incorporate magnesium-rich foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, and leafy greens to prevent cramps and aid in muscle relaxation after training.
    Essential Nutrients:

    Iron: Red meat, spinach, beans
    Calcium: Dairy products, fortified plant milks, leafy greens
    Magnesium: Almonds, spinach, black beans
    Vitamin D: Fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified foods (milk, cereals)
